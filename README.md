# hyperbolicEmbeddings_team4
Hyperbolic embeddings repository for team 4 - Santiago Cortés, David Ricardo Valencia and Juan Manuel Gutiérrez.

The base was used using this [repository]. The code used for such was this one:
```sh
$  julia combinatorial/comb.jl -d data/edges/music.edges -m music_edges.emb -e 1.0 -p 64 -r 2 -a -s
```
    
remember to use the docker for avoid compatibility issues.
```sh
$  sh run_docker.sh
```
